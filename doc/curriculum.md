## Program Description

This updated Certificate in Data Science equips learners with developer fundamentals and the full data science workflow. Students start with essential tools (Git, GitHub, CLI, HTML/CSS, containerization, prompt engineering) before moving into Python programming, data wrangling, visualization, and machine learning.

The program ensures that graduates not only understand core data science concepts but also know how to work like modern developers — collaborating on GitHub, deploying models in containers, and leveraging AI tools for productivity.

Learners graduate ready for entry-level data analyst, ML engineer, or freelance AI/data consultant roles and all data related roles.

## Curriculum Structure

### Module 0: Developer Fundamentals & Tools(5%)

(Pre-Data Science Bootcamp)
- **Knowledge:**
  - Command Line Interface (CLI) basics.
  - Git & GitHub: version control, branching, pull requests.
  - HTML/CSS essentials (for dashboards & data apps).
  - Containerization basics (Docker).
  - Prompt Engineering: using AI tools effectively.
- **Skills:**
  - Create and manage repositories on GitHub.
  - Navigate Linux CLI for data tasks.
  - Build simple static web pages with HTML/CSS.
  - Containerize a small project (hello-world app).
  - Craft effective prompts for AI tools like ChatGPT/Copilot.
- **Competency:**
  Work in a collaborative, industry-standard developer environment.

**System Architecture Integration:** This module aligns with the repo's foundational structure. Class_notes/week-01 contains CLI and Git tutorials. Assignments/week-01 introduces basic repo setup. Submissions/assignments/week-01 tracks initial tool proficiency. The dashboard monitors tool adoption rates, while system-design/implementations provides basic container examples in Python.

⸻

### Module 1: Programming Foundations with Python(55 %)
- **Knowledge:**
  - Data types, variables, operators, branching, iteration.
  - Functions, recursion, exceptions.
  - OOP (classes, inheritance, polymorphism).
  - Algorithmic thinking & complexity analysis.
- **Skills:**
  - Write clean Python code.
  - Use libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
  - Debugging & virtual environments.
- **Competency:**
  Build efficient, modular Python programs.

**System Architecture Integration:** Core programming weeks (Class_notes/week-02 to week-10) cover these topics. Assignments/week-02 to week-10 provide practice files. Submissions/assignments/week-02 to week-10 are organized by week for tracking OOP and algorithm submissions. Dashboard visualizes Python proficiency trends, with system-design/python examples demonstrating modular code in rate limiting and load balancing.

⸻

### Module 2: SQL, Pandas & Data Manipulation(10%)
- Relational databases, schemas, normalization.
- SQL queries: SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, JOINS.
- Connect Python ↔ SQL (sqlite3, SQLAlchemy).
- Pandas for cleaning, wrangling, merging datasets.

**System Architecture Integration:** Covered in Class_notes/week-11 to week-12. Assignments/week-11 focuses on SQL-Python integration. Submissions track data manipulation files. Dashboard includes metrics for data cleaning completion, linking to system-design for ETL pipeline basics in Module 5.

⸻

### Module 3: Data Analysis & Visualization(10)
- Descriptive statistics, probability basics.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Visualization with Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
- Build dashboards with Streamlit/Dash.

**System Architecture Integration:** Class_notes/week-13 to week-16 cover EDA and viz. Assignments/week-13 to week-16 include visualization tasks. Submissions organized accordingly. Dashboard uses these skills for its own visualizations, with system-design/implementations showing dashboard deployment patterns.

⸻

### Module 4: Machine Learning Foundations(10%)
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning.
- Algorithms: Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest.
- Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, ROC.
- Train/test ML models with Scikit-Learn.

**System Architecture Integration:** Class_notes/week-17 to week-20 introduce ML. Assignments/week-17 to week-20 for model building. Submissions track ML notebooks. Dashboard analyzes ML assignment completion, integrating with system-design for model deployment in Module 5.

⸻

### Module 5: System Design & Model Deployment(10 %)
- Pipelines & ETL basics.
- Model deployment (Flask/FastAPI).
- MLOps intro (monitoring, APIs, Docker).
- End-to-end workflow: ingestion → preprocessing → model → dashboard.

**System Architecture Integration:** Class_notes/week-21 to week-22 cover deployment. Assignments/week-21 to week-22 for pipelines. Submissions for capstone prototypes. The entire system-design/ folder supports this module with implementations in Python and Java for consistent hashing, load balancing, rate limiting. Dashboard serves as a live example of end-to-end deployment via Vercel.

## Capstone Project (Showcase) —> this your Crown not mine to shine

Learners complete an individual or group end-to-end project:
- Problem statement + dataset selection.
- Preprocessing & feature engineering.
- ML model training & evaluation.
- Dashboard/visual report.
- Deployment (API or containerized app).

**Example Projects:**
- Customer churn prediction dashboard.
- Social media sentiment tracker.
- Retail demand forecasting tool.
- API-based recommendation system.

**System Architecture Integration:** Capstone submissions in Submissions/projects/. Use repo structure for full workflow: Class_notes for guidance, system-design for deployment patterns, dashboard for visualization prototype. Track capstone progress via dashboard metrics.
