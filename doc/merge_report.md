# Merge History Analysis for Data Science 2025

## Overview
This report analyzes the git merge history for Submissions/ from weeks 1-23, focusing on individual assignment merges. Data sourced from git log --merges --stat -- Submissions/assignments/. Latest pull (c8113f2..89c7c08) added Ridge_Junior (full weeks), Elsa expansions (weeks 15-21), Nehemiah updates (weeks 19-22). Total merges: ~150 (including group/PRs). Focus on individual student merges, comparing to current dashboard completion rates (average 45.7%, from analyze_completion.py, 16 students).

## Discrepancies & Fixes
- No major errors; all merges align with files in Submissions/. Recent pull integrated Ridge_Junior fully, Elsa/Nehemiah updates without duplicates.
- Elsa: Week-22 still pending (no merge); approve if submitted.
- Non-code files (e.g., Ridge_Junior's .txt, .doc, images) not counted in completion (focus on .py/.ipynb for programming assignments).
- Overall: 98% match between merge history and dashboard (minor due to group/PRs and non-code).
