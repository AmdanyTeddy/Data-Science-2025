- Optimize performance for large-scale computations
- Integrate Dask with existing Python data science workflows

## Key Concepts

### 1. Parallel Computing Fundamentals
- CPU-bound vs IO-bound tasks
- Threading vs multiprocessing
- Memory constraints and data partitioning

### 2. Dask Architecture
- Task graphs and lazy evaluation
- Schedulers: synchronous, threads, processes, distributed
- Client-server model for distributed computing
- Integration with existing Python libraries

### 3. Dask APIs
- **Dask Arrays**: Parallel NumPy operations
- **Dask DataFrames**: Parallel pandas operations
- **Dask Bags**: Parallel processing of Python objects
