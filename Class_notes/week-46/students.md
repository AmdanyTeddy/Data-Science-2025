param_grid = {
    'C': [0.1, 1, 10],
    'penalty': ['l1', 'l2']
}

class NewsItem(BaseModel):
    text: str
    source: str = None
    timestamp: str = None

model = joblib.load('fake_news_model.pkl')
vectorizer = joblib.load('tfidf_vectorizer.pkl')

@app.post("/predict")
def predict_news(item: NewsItem):
    # Preprocess text
    processed_text = preprocess_text(item.text)

    # Vectorize
    features = vectorizer.transform([processed_text])

    # Predict
    prediction = model.predict(features)[0]
    probability = model.predict_proba(features)[0]

    return {
        "prediction": "fake" if prediction == 1 else "real",
        "confidence": float(max(probability)),
        "processing_time": "0.15s"
    }
```

```

import torch.nn as nn

class FakeNewsClassifier(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, batch_first=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 1)
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()

    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(embedded)
        out = self.fc(lstm_out[:, -1, :])
        return self.sigmoid(out)
```
