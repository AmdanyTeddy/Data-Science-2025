# Lecture 14.1: Overview of Machine Learning Classification

## Key Learning Objectives
- Understand the role of classification in supervised learning
- Differentiate between classification and regression tasks
- Recognize real-world applications of classification algorithms
- Understand the module structure and learning progression

## Core Concepts

### What is Classification?
- **Definition**: Predicting categorical labels or classes for input data
- **Examples**:
  - Email spam detection (spam/not spam)
  - Customer churn prediction (will churn/will not churn)
  - Medical diagnosis (disease present/absent)
  - Image recognition (cat/dog/car)

### Classification vs Regression
| Aspect | Classification | Regression |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Output | Discrete categories | Continuous values |
| Examples | Yes/No, Red/Blue/Green | Price, Temperature, Age |
| Algorithms | Decision Trees, SVM, KNN | Linear Regression, Neural Networks |
| Evaluation | Accuracy, Precision, Recall | MSE, RMSE, RÂ² |

### Types of Classification
1. **Binary Classification**: Two classes (e.g., spam/not spam)
2. **Multi-class Classification**: Three or more classes (e.g., iris species)
3. **Multi-label Classification**: Multiple labels per instance
