## Module Overview

This module introduces Apache Spark, a unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. Students will learn how Spark enables distributed computing across clusters while maintaining a familiar programming interface.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the limitations of single-machine data processing
- Master Spark's core abstractions: RDDs, DataFrames, and Datasets
- Implement distributed data processing pipelines
- Compare Spark with traditional MapReduce approaches
- Apply Spark SQL for structured data analysis
- Deploy Spark applications in different environments

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Big Data Problem
- Single machine limitations with large datasets
- Memory constraints and processing bottlenecks
- Need for distributed computing frameworks

### 2. Spark Architecture
- Driver program and cluster manager
- Executors and task distribution
- Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)
- Lazy evaluation and optimization

### 3. Spark APIs
- RDD API: Low-level distributed objects
- DataFrame API: High-level relational operations
- Dataset API: Type-safe structured data
- Spark SQL: SQL queries on distributed data

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Caching and persistence strategies
- Partitioning and shuffling
- Broadcast variables and accumulators
- Memory management best practices

## Practical Applications

- Large-scale ETL operations
- Real-time stream processing
- Machine learning at scale
- Graph processing and analytics
- Interactive data exploration

## Prerequisites

- Python programming fundamentals
