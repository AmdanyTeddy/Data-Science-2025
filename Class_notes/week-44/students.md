- **T-shirt Sizing:** XS, S, M, L, XL for rough estimates

## Code Quality and Collaboration

### Version Control Best Practices
- **Git Workflow:**
  - Feature branches for new work
  - Pull requests for code review
  - Regular commits with clear messages
  - Code review before merging

- **Branching Strategy:**
  - Main/Master: Production-ready code
  - Develop: Integration branch
  - Feature branches: Individual features
  - Release branches: Pre-production testing

### Code Review Guidelines
- **Reviewer Responsibilities:**
  - Check for bugs and logic errors
  - Ensure code follows standards
  - Suggest improvements
  - Verify tests are included

- **Author Responsibilities:**
  - Write clear, self-documenting code
  - Include tests and documentation
  - Respond to feedback constructively
  - Make requested changes

## Conflict Resolution

### Common Sources of Conflict
- **Technical Disagreements:** Different approaches to solve problems
- **Resource Allocation:** Competing priorities and deadlines
- **Communication Breakdowns:** Misunderstandings or lack of clarity
- **Personality Clashes:** Different working styles or preferences

### Resolution Strategies

#### 1. Prevention
- Clear role definitions
- Regular communication
- Shared goals and objectives
- Respect for different perspectives

#### 2. Early Intervention
- Address issues promptly
- Private conversations for sensitive topics
- Focus on facts, not personalities
- Seek win-win solutions

#### 3. Mediation
- Involve neutral third party
- Use structured problem-solving
- Document agreements
- Follow up on resolutions

## Remote Team Collaboration

### Challenges and Solutions

#### Time Zone Differences
- **Challenge:** Asynchronous work patterns
- **Solutions:**
  - Flexible scheduling
  - Recorded meetings
  - Overlapping work hours
  - Clear communication expectations

#### Communication Barriers
- **Challenge:** Lack of non-verbal cues
- **Solutions:**
  - Use video when possible
  - Be explicit in written communication
  - Regular check-ins
  - Cultural sensitivity training

#### Technology Issues
- **Challenge:** Tool compatibility and access
- **Solutions:**
  - Standardized tool stack
  - Reliable internet requirements
  - Backup communication channels
  - Regular technology audits

### Best Practices for Remote Teams
- **Daily Rituals:**
  - Morning check-ins
  - End-of-day status updates
  - Weekly team meetings

- **Virtual Team Building:**
