## Module Overview

This module explores Apache HBase, a distributed, scalable, big data store modeled after Google's Bigtable. Students will learn how HBase enables random, real-time read/write access to large datasets stored in HDFS.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand NoSQL database concepts and HBase architecture
- Master HBase data model: tables, rows, column families, and cells
- Implement efficient data ingestion and retrieval patterns
- Design HBase schemas for different use cases
- Integrate HBase with Hadoop ecosystem tools
- Apply HBase for real-time analytics and random access patterns

## Key Concepts

### 1. NoSQL vs RDBMS
- Limitations of traditional relational databases for big data
- CAP theorem and eventual consistency
- HBase as a column-family NoSQL database

### 2. HBase Architecture
- HMaster and RegionServer components
- HDFS integration for persistent storage
- ZooKeeper for coordination
- Write-Ahead Log (WAL) and MemStore

### 3. Data Model
- Tables, rows, and column families
- Column qualifiers and timestamps
- Sparse data storage benefits
- Row key design principles

### 4. HBase Operations
- Put, Get, Scan, and Delete operations
- Batch operations and atomic transactions
- Filters and secondary indexing
- Coprocessors for server-side processing

## Practical Applications

- Time-series data storage
- Internet of Things (IoT) data management
- User profile and preference storage
- Log data analytics
- Real-time dashboards and reporting

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of distributed systems
- Basic knowledge of Hadoop and HDFS
- Familiarity with database concepts
- Python programming skills

## Required Software

- Python 3.13+
- Apache HBase 2.x
- Apache Hadoop/HDFS
- Apache ZooKeeper
- HappyBase (Python HBase client)
- UV package manager

## Lab Exercises

### Lab 1: HBase Environment Setup
- Configure HBase cluster
- Verify HDFS connectivity
- Install Python client libraries

### Lab 2: Data Model Design
- Design HBase table schemas
- Implement row key strategies
- Create column families and qualifiers

### Lab 3: Basic CRUD Operations
- Insert, update, and delete data
- Implement batch operations
- Handle versioning and timestamps

### Lab 4: Query Patterns
- Implement scan operations
- Use filters for data retrieval
- Optimize query performance

### Lab 5: Integration Examples
- Connect HBase with Spark
- Implement data pipelines
- Build real-time analytics dashboards

## Assessment Criteria

- Successful design and implementation of HBase schemas
- Efficient data ingestion and retrieval operations
- Understanding of HBase performance characteristics
- Ability to integrate HBase with other big data tools

## Resources

- [Apache HBase Documentation](https://hbase.apache.org/book.html)
- [HBase: The Definitive Guide Book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hbase-the-definitive/9781492024258/)
- [HappyBase Documentation](https://happybase.readthedocs.io/)

## Support

For technical issues or questions:
1. Check the setup.md file for environment configuration
2. Review HBase documentation for architecture details
3. Consult with instructor during lab sessions
4. Use HBase mailing lists for advanced issues

## Common Challenges

- Row key design for optimal performance
- Handling hotspotting in writes
- Managing region splits and compactions
- Balancing consistency vs. performance trade-offs

## Next Steps

After completing this module, students should be prepared for:
- Advanced HBase tuning and optimization
- Integration with other NoSQL technologies
- Big data architecture design patterns
- Real-world big data application development
