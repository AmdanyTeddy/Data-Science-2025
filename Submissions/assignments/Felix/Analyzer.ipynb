Students will process user input strings, count and categorize characters,\n","# search for patterns, compute numeric statistics, and convert numbers into binary. The project is comprehensive—covering all major iteration patterns from Topics 1–3—and will be submitted via a GitHub classroom repository.\n","\n","# Project Description\n","# Build a commandline Python application named analyzer.py that:\n","# String Analysis\n","# Counts: total characters, vowels, consonants, digits, and punctuation.\n","# Detects: the first and last occurrence of a usersupplied substring.\n","# Lists: all unique words (caseinsensitive), sorted alphabetically.\n","# Numeric Statistics\n","# Accepts a commaseparated list of integers from the user.\n","# Computes: sum, average (mean), minimum, and maximum using loops (no builtins like sum()).\n","# Flags: numbers divisible by 3 or 5, printing them with a label.\n","# Binary Converter\n","# Prompts the user for a positive or negative integer.\n","# Converts it to binary using the remainderdivision method (while loop), handling sign.\n","# Displays the binary string.\n","# Menu & Loop Control\n","# Presents a menu to the user to choose any of the above functions or exit.\n","# Uses a while True: loop with break/continue to manage the menu.\n","\n","# Objectives for the Project\n","# Apply for loops to iterate over strings, lists, and ranges\n","# Use while loops for conditional repetition and number conversion.\n","# Employ break and continue to control loop flow.\n","# Implement nested loops for complex tasks (e.g., word extraction).\n","# Manage Boolean flags to detect conditions (e.g., substring found).\n","# Practice input/output and robust error handling.\n","\n","# Requirements & Constraints\n","# No use of builtin aggregators: you must implement your own loops for counting and summing (no sum(), min(), max(), or count() methods).\n","# String processing: use both indexbased (range(len(s))) and direct (for ch in s) loops at least once each.\n","# Modular code: separate functionality into functions:\n","# analyze_text(s: str) -> dict\n","# stats_numbers(nums: list[int]) -> dict\n","# to_binary(n: int) -> str\n","# main_menu(): drives the program loop.\n","# Input validation: reject invalid inputs with error messages and reprompt.\n","# Documentation: include docstrings for every function and inline comments for loop logic.\n","# Style: adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines; use meaningful variable names.\n","\n","# Deliverables\n","# analyzer.py: the project source file.\n","# README.md in the root of your GitHub folder:\n","# Brief project overview.\n","# Instructions for running (e.g., python analyzer.py).\n","# Sample input/output transcript.\n","\n","\n","# Programm that conducts String Analysis.\n","#1.
