# 📊 Data Science 2025 Python Assignments – Assignments by Ridge Junior Abuto

This repository contains my weekly assignments for the **Data Science 2025** course.  
Each assignment is saved as a Python script (`assignment_X.py`) with some challenges split into sub-files (e.g., `assignment_5_challenge_2.py`).

## 📌 Notes
- Each assignment builds on concepts from the lectures.  
- Some assignments include **charts/plots** (`grade_analysis.png`, `grades_fileio.png`) to illustrate complexity or data visualization.  
- Code is organized for clarity and maintainability with **commit messages per week**.

## 🚀 Running the Assignments
To run an assignment:

```bash
python assignment_X.py
````

Replace `X` with the assignment number (e.g., `python assignment_10.py`).
