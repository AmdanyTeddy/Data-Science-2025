## üéØ Week 23 Highlights: Complexity Classes Analysis

This week's assignment focuses on **algorithm complexity analysis** with:

- **`complexity_analysis.py`**: Python implementation featuring:
  - Mystery function analysis (Œò(n¬≤) complexity)
  - Binary search with Œò(log n) complexity proof
  - Recursive vs iterative Fibonacci implementations
  - Runtime comparison and automatic PNG generation

- **Comprehensive report** with complexity classifications and proofs
- **Visualizations** comparing exponential vs linear runtime growth
- **Theoretical complexity curves** for educational reference

## üìå Notes

- Each assignment builds on concepts from the lectures
- Includes charts/plots to illustrate complexity and data visualization
- Code is organized for clarity with commit messages per week
- Week 23 demonstrates understanding of asymptotic complexity and different complexity classes

## üöÄ Running the Assignments

To run any assignment:

```bash
python assignment_X.py
```

Replace `X` with the assignment number (e.g., `python assignment_23.py` for complexity analysis).
