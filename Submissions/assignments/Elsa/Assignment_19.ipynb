        "The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) guided my design by ensuring that the HealthProfile class focuses only on storing and managing personal health data. It handles user attributes such as name, age, weight, height, and gender, and provides methods to calculate BMI and BMR ‚Äî two essential health metrics. I intentionally excluded any workout, calorie tracking, or nutrition logic because those would represent separate responsibilities. By keeping this class dedicated solely to data and basic health calculations, the code becomes cleaner, easier to maintain, and more reusable. If fitness tracking or diet planning features are added later, they can be implemented in separate classes without changing the HealthProfile class."

        "The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. In this design, the CalorieCalculator base class defines a general interface (calculate()), while subclasses like Walking, Running, and Swimming extend it with their own calorie formulas. If new activities (like Cycling or Yoga) need to be added, we can simply create new subclasses without altering the existing code. The ActivityPlanner class works with any subclass through polymorphism, ensuring flexibility and scalability. This approach prevents breaking existing functionality, makes the system easier to maintain, and allows for smooth expansion as more activities are introduced ‚Äî fully aligning with the OCP design principle."
