#Python Code :

L1 = ['sun']
#L1 points to a list that contain "sun"
L2 = L1
#L2 is  alias to L1 and points to the list "sun"
L1 = ['moon']
#L1 is reassigned to a new list containing 'moon'
#It does not change L2 as L2 still holds the value for the original L1

print(L2) #outputs ['sun']


['sun']

# Step 1: Create a list of 10 names (with some duplicates)
names = ["Alice", "Brian", "Cynthia", "Alice", "Diana", "Ethan", "Brian", "Grace", "Helen", "Cynthia"]

# Step 2: Remove duplicates using a set
unique_names = set(names)

# Step 3: Sort alphabetically
sorted_names = sorted(unique_names)

# Step 4: Print the result
print("Sorted names:", sorted_names)


Sorted names: ['Alice', 'Brian', 'Cynthia', 'Diana', 'Ethan', 'Grace', 'Helen']
